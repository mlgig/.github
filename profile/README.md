# Welcome to MLGIG!

This is the home for open code, data and research publications for MLGIG (Machine Learning Research Group of [Dr Georgiana Ifrim](https://people.ucd.ie/georgiana.ifrim)).
Below is a list of our public repositories organised mainly into Time Series Classification (algorithms, applications), Time Series Explanation (algorithms, applications) and Data Challenges.

## Data Challenges
